Creates a set of Last FM widgets for your WP or WPMU blog.

== Description ==

Last.FM offers a set of "widgets" which you can embed in your WordPress Blog. This plug in basically re-creates those "widgets" as proper WordPress Sidebar widgets. 

The configuration page allows you to set your Last.FM user name, the colour of the widgets (from Last.FM's small list) and a few other options.


== Installation ==


1. Upload `lastfm.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory in your WordPress or WordPress MU installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or WordPress MU
3. Configure the plugin and set your Last.FM user name and any other options you wish to set.
3. Drag the Widgets in the Template layout into the side bars.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are the Widgets slightly smaller that the Last.FM ones? =

The Last.FM widget code provided by Last.FM means the widgets are too wide for many WP theme sidebars and so these have been "trimmed" slightly to hopefully not cause problems.
